    abstract = {The Higgs Boson Machine Learning Challenge (HiggsML or the Challenge for short) was
    organized to promote collaboration between high energy physicists and data scientists.
    The ATLAS experiment at CERN provided simulated data that has been used by physicists
    in a search for the Higgs boson. The Challenge was organized by a small group of ATLAS
    physicists and data scientists. It was hosted by Kaggle at https://www.kaggle. com/c/higgs-boson;
    the challenge data is now available on http://opendata.cern.ch/ collection/ATLAS-Higgs-Challenge-2014.
    This paper provides the physics background and explains the challenge setting, the
    challenge design, and analyzes its results.},
